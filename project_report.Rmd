# Background

## Motivation & Related Work

Our project focuses on analyzing the relationship between Lyme disease case prevalence, tick populations, and environmental factors in New York State (NYS). Lyme disease is a vector borne disease with long term side effects that contribute to a meaningful amount of morbidity. We are interested in  regional variations in Lyme disease and how environmental factors influence the spread of the disease. Many members of our team came to Columbia to study infectious disease epidemiology and are interested in using skills from P8105 in future research. 

## Questions We Wanted to Answer 

We sought to:

1. Characterize the distribution of Lyme disease cases across NYS counties.

2. Explore any correlation between tick population density and Lyme disease incidence.

3. Understand if and how environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation, predict tick disease rates.

## Questions We Did Answer

1. Through summary statistics and mapping we characterized the distribution of Lyme disease cases across counties in NYS between 2019 and 2021. 

2. Using a heat map we charted average temperature in NYS counties to visually assess whether case density and temperature appear related. 

3. Using a linear model we explored the relationship between the percentage of collected ticks that carry the bacteria which causes Lyme disease and the cases of Lyme disease. We also included average yearly temperature per county. 


# Data

## Sources

To explore our interests we required:

1. County level data on tick prevalence and percentage of those ticks carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. We obtained this data from the NYS Department of health (DOH) [here](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Deer-Tick-Surveillance-Nymphs-May-to-Sept-excludin/kibp-u2ip/data). 

2. County level data on incident cases of Lyme disease. We also got this from the NYS DOH [here](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Community-Health-Lyme-Disease-Incidence-Rate-per-1/6sxr-cqij).  

3. County level climate data for New York which we obtained [here](https://data.pnj.com/weather-data/new-york/36/1976-03-01/). 

4. Geospatial shape data for graphing which we obtained from [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home). 


## Data Import & Initial Tidying

We employed the `tidyverse`, `rvest`, `sf`, `purrr`, `readxl`, `dplyr`, and `janitor` packages for data wrangling, cleaning, and spatial analysis.

The Lyme disease dataset was loaded from a CSV file (`new_york_county_lyme.csv`). The data were cleaned to standardize column names using the `janitor::clean_names()` function. Relevant variables (`county_name`, `event_count`, `percent_rate`) were selected, renamed, and a new column, `data`, was added to verify merging accuracy:
- `NAME`: County name.
- `lyme_count`: Number of reported Lyme disease events.
- `lyme_rate`: Percentage rate of Lyme disease.

Tick surveillance data were imported from `Deer_Tick_Surveillance__Adults__Oct_to_Dec__excluding_Powassan_virus__Beginning_2008_20241116.csv`. After standardizing column names, we filtered data for the years 2019â€“2021 to align with the Lyme disease data. Columns unrelated to analysis were removed, and new variables were created:
- `NAME`: Renamed from `county` to enable merging.
- `ticks_tested`: Total ticks tested in each county.
- `data`: Added to distinguish during merging.

A shapefile of New York counties (`Counties.shp`) was imported using the `sf` package to facilitate spatial analysis. The shapefile retained its spatial attributes, enabling integration with non-spatial datasets.

## Merging Datasets

The tick surveillance and Lyme disease datasets were merged using the `full_join()` function, aligning by `NAME`. The resulting dataset was then joined with the county shapefile using `left_join()` to incorporate spatial information.

Temperature data were imported from `avg_temp_county.csv`. Data cleaning involved:
- Standardizing column names.
- Selecting temperature-related variables (monthly data).
- Removing rows with missing data.
- Renaming `county` to `name` for consistency.
- Removing the "County" suffix from county names to enable merging.

The cleaned temperature data were merged with the previously combined dataset.

## Adding Variables: Average Temperature

Monthly temperatures for each county were averaged for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 using `rowMeans()`:
- Variables `jan_19` to `dec_19`, `jan_20` to `dec_20`, and `jan_21` to `dec_21` were used to calculate yearly averages.
- Unnecessary monthly columns were dropped after computing averages.

## Final Analytic Dataset

The datasets for 2019, 2020, and 2021 were combined using `bind_rows()`. This final dataset included:
- Yearly average temperature for each county.
- Lyme disease rates.
- Tick surveillance metrics.

The final combined dataset, containing integrated Lyme disease, tick surveillance, and temperature data, was exported as a CSV file (`combined_data_kf.csv`) for use in analysis. It contained `138` rows and `27` columns. 

The code associated with this work is available [here](sarahy_dataclean.html). 

# Exploratory & Visual Analyses

The dataset was imported from `combined_data_kf.csv`. Minor corrections were applied to fix spelling errors in county names (`Cattaragus` was corrected to `Cattaraugus`, and `St Lawrance` to `St. Lawrance`) using the `mutate()` and `case_when()` functions from the `dplyr` package.


## Summary Statistics

Descriptive statistics for each county were calculated using `tbl_summary()` and `group_by()` with summary functions. Variables included:
- `lyme_count`
- `avg_temp`
- `b_burgdorferi_percent`

Two summary tables were created:
- A detailed `tbl_summary` table with summary statistics for all counties, saved as an HTML file (`Results/table.1.html`).
- A `gt` table summarizing years with data, mean Lyme cases, mean temperature, and mean `b_burgdorferi_percent`, saved as `Results/table.1.html`.

## Cases Over Time

The total Lyme disease cases per year were summarized using `group_by()` and `summarize()`. A line plot (`geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`) was created to visualize trends in total cases, saved as `cases_per_year.png`.

## Geospatial Data Processing and Visualizations

**Data Visualizations for 2019, 2020, and 2021**  
   - Data was reshaped using `pivot_longer()` to include month-year combinations for temperature analysis.
   - A function `generate_map()` was defined to filter data by year, overlay Lyme disease counts, and produce interactive Leaflet maps.
   - The function used `addPolygons()` to render counties with color gradients representing `lyme_count` and `addLegend()` to display a legend for case counts.

**Data Visualizations for 2022**  
   - A heat map of average temperatures by county was created using `ggplot2` with `geom_sf()` to map `avg_temp`.
   - Correlation between `avg_temp` and `avg_lyme_rate` was calculated using `cor()` and visualized with a scatterplot. A linear regression line was overlaid using `geom_smooth()`.

## EDA Outputs
- **Interactive Maps**: Interactive maps were generated for each year using the `generate_map()` function and saved as interactive objects for web embedding. View them [here](file:///Users/kalebfrierson/Desktop/MPH/Year%202/Fall%20Semester%202024/Data%20Science%20I%20/Final/website/nyslymedisease_project_website/dashboard.html). The code for dashboard development is [here](dashboard.rmd). 
- **Heat Maps**: We generated a heat map of average temperatures by county were created for 2022 using `geom_sf()` with color scales (`scale_fill_viridis_c()`).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Scatterplots and correlation coefficients were used to explore the relationship between temperature and Lyme rates.

# Regression Analysis 

## Visualizing Assumptions

We assessed the distributions of variables we sought to include in our model. 

- **Lyme Disease Cases**:
  The distribution of `lyme_count` was visualized using `ggplot2` with a histogram (`geom_histogram()`), showing density and right-skewed data.
- **Boxplot by Year**:
  A boxplot of `lyme_count` by `year` was created, adding a red dot to represent the mean value using `stat_summary()`.
- **Log Transformation**:
  To normalize the skewed distribution of `lyme_count`, a log10 transformation was applied, and a histogram of the transformed values (`log_cases`) was created.

- **Temperature**
A histogram of average temperature (`avg_temp`) was created using `geom_histogram()`, confirming a normal distribution. 
- **Tick Surveillance**
The prevalence of Lyme disease bacteria in ticks (`b_burgdorferi_percent`) was visualized with a histogram and overlaid density plot (`geom_density()`). The plot confirmed a normal distribution.

All plots were saved as PNG files using `ggsave()` with filenames (`histogram_cases.png`, `boxplots_cases_year.png`, `histogram_log_cases.png`, `temperature_distribution.png`, `tickwithbdistribution.png`) in the `Results` directory.


## The Model

A linear regression model (`lm()`) was fitted to examine the association between `log_cases` and `b_burgdorferi_percent`, controlling for `avg_temp`. Results were summarized in a table using the `gtsummary` package (`tbl_regression()`) and exported as an HTML file (`Results/regress.html`).

The code associated with regression modeling can be viewed [here](regression_coding.html). 

#Discussion

Our analysis revealed that the statistical distribution of Lyme disease cases remained consistent across the three years of interest (2019â€“2021). This suggests a relatively stable burden of disease over time, despite year-to-year variations in environmental and population factors. Through geographic visualization, we observed that areas in the southern part of New York State, including New York City and Long Island, showed higher incidence rates of Lyme disease. While the correlation analysis indicated a slight decrease in Lyme cases as average annual temperature increased, this relationship may be confounded by population density. Warmer areas, such as the southern counties, are also the most densely populated, which could explain the observed trend.

A clear and expected relationship emerged between the percentage of ticks carrying the Lyme disease-causing bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi) and the incidence of Lyme disease cases in each county. This aligns with existing literature and reinforces the importance of tick surveillance programs in understanding and predicting Lyme disease risks.
